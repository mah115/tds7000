Hi,

The Program supports the TDS5000(B), TDS7000(B), CSA7000(B), TDS6000(B/C), DPO7000 and DSA/DPO70000 (No Letters) Series. For the more recent MSO70000 Series I don't know.

I used for my TDS7404B Option Masks: 10 44 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF (14 x F). With this I enabled as far as I know all possible Options for the TDS7000B Series (i.c.w. Scope Application V 5.1.3), including Max Record Length (64 Mp). With help of:

I installed TDSVNM (former App. 61) and TDSPTD (former App. 69) Option Modules.

Succes,
